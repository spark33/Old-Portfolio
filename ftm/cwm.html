	<h1>Code with Music!</h1>

	<p>
		Split your team up into two-- the players and the movers.
	</p>

	<h3>Players</h3>

	<p>
		Players will have to communicate the correct sequence of moves to get the movers to the target by using sounds. For example:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>1 claps = Turn Left</li>
		<li>2 claps = Turn Right</li>
		<li>3 claps = Move</li>
	</ul>

	<hr/>

	<h3>Movers</h3>

	<p>Movers will listen to the sounds played by the players and move the car accordingly. Once the vehicle has reached the target, tell the TA and you will receive a word if you are correct.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>
		When you’re ready, tell the TA who the players and movers are. Once you’ve gotten your sheets, <b>no one is allowed to speak!</b>
	</p>

	<h3>There will be point penalties if you speak!</h3>

						<h1>Scheduler</h1>
						<h5>
							<b>I created a employee scheduling app for CMU Computing Services to replace WhenToWork.com.</b> After analyzing data on issues and competing apps, I led a team of 3 developers and wrote code all across the MEAN stack.

						<p class="center"><i>Screenshots of the final product.</i></p>
						<p>
							As a scheduling manager for CMU Computing Services, I was asked to manipulate the department’s schedule for student employees on WhenToWork.com. I was absolutely disgusted by the app’s unintuitive interface, lack of flexibility in shift planning and unnecessarily complex user stories; many of them were manually done on other software. The department was also using more than 5 apps to support its functions; any developer would have recognized how easy it would be to support all of them using one app.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><img src="images/test.jpg" /></li>
							<li><img src="images/test.jpg" /></li>
							<li><img src="images/test.jpg" /></li>
						</ul>
						<p class="center"><i>WhenToWork’s complex interface was causing unnecessary frustration and countless wasted hours.</i></p>
						<p>
							I did not want to work with this app for the next two years. I decided to create a more elegant solution and present it to the department head. I first surveyed current employees to assess issues with WhenToWork and defined focus points for the new app. I then designed the app, a project timeline and MongoDB document structures before onboarding a designer and another developer; neither had previous experience with the MEAN stack.
						</p>

							<li><img src="images/test.jpg" /></li>

							<li><img src="images/test.jpg" /></li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							We utilized Skype and Github to collaborate often. Within a month, we had a fully functional app hosted on Heroku. For users, the app made scheduling reports and submitting reports easier than ever. For administrators, the app performed data analysis that they were previously doing on separate Excel spreadsheets and made it easier to view composite data on all employees and their reports.
						</p>
						<p>
							Although the app is fully functional, it is still going through revisions and does not support a view-only demo account. If you are interested in the project, please contact me for more information.

						<h1>Seoul 53 Hotel</h1>
						<h5>
							I recreated the website for Seoul 53 Hotel using AngularJS/HTML5/CSS3/JS and hosted it on a Vultr server. The final website supported instant translation and PHP form-handling.
						</h5>
						<ul>
							<li><img src="images/test.jpg" /></li>
							<li><img src="images/test.jpg" /></li>
							<li><img src="images/test.jpg" /></li>
						</ul>
						<p class="center"><i>Screenshots of the final product.</i></p>
						<p>
							I analyzed the issues with the current website and interacted frequently with the client to assess the website’s requirements. The previous website had too many links and too many words, with a non-mobile responsive interface. It also included outdated modules and information and not enough user interaction. The objective was to recreate the website with more emphasis on the important content and mobile responsiveness.
						</p>
						<p>
							While the client began curating the text and images they wanted to display, I designed high-fidelity prototypes using HTML5/CSS3/JS/PHP and styled it using Materialize. I presented the prototypes and explained my thought process behind the designs.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><img src="images/test.jpg" /></li>
							<li><img src="images/test.jpg" /></li>
							<li><img src="images/test.jpg" /></li>

							<li><img src="images/test.jpg" /></li>
							<li><img src="images/test.jpg" /></li>
						</ul>
						<p class="center"><i>Design 2</i></p>
						<p>
							After receiving the prototype, they requested that the website support instant translation between multiple languages. I also learned that as a new hotel, they were constantly changing their prices and interior design. As the client was not familiar with HTML, I then decided that AngularJS would be more appropriate for this project. By centralizing all information with controllers, the client would simply have to edit JSON files to later change content across all language sites or add new languages.
						</p>
						<p>
							After converting all content to AngularJS, the website was optimized for search engine display and faster loading speed. Finally, after adding the final touches and confirming all translated content with the client, the project was hosted at __. Feel free to take a look and provide any feedback.

						<h1>Hayden's Shoes <br/>Data Visualization</h1>

						<h1>Prantl's Bakery Website</h1>

							As a beatboxer, instrumentalist and singer, I always wanted to create tracks on my own using an audio looper. However, not only were they expensive, I wasn’t sure I would know how to use it properly. When 15-112 gave me the opportunity to create whatever I wanted, I decided to build one.
